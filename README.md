This is a brief analysis of Toronto's Airbnb Listings. The goal is to use this data to answer 3 major questions:
Which listing was booked the most?
How does price affect booking i.e. if the price of a listing is low does it get booked more?
What time of the year gets booked the most in Toronto?

The dataset was retrieved from AirBnb's open data website: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html
